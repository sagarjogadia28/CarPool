Carpool is an Android application created to provide ease to regular riders in different parts of Ontario which allows users to share the ride with others by posting advertisement for rides. The application lets users share the commuting costs with other persons heading the same way.

> Acts as a centralized system for carpooling without relying on different chat groups and individual messaging to share a ride.
